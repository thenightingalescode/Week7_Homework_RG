            <p>For most of the show's run, she serves as Deputy Director of the Parks and Recreation Department of the fictional city of Pawnee, Indiana. An over-achiever, Knope believes the government should serve the people.</p>

            <p>She lives for her job in the city government, waffles from JJ's Diner and making all of her friend as happy as can be. She displays the photographs of Madeline Albright, Condoleezza Rice, Janet Reno, and Nancy Pelosi. Leslie is a proud member of numerous action committees in and around City Hall, including, but not limited to: Dick Lovers Anonymous, the Equal Opportunity Committee, the Fun in the Sun Committee, the Clean Restroom Task Force, the Increased Access to Restrooms Task Force, the Handicapped Restroom Task Force, the Committee for Repainting Handicapped Parking Spaces Task Force, and the Task Force to Reduce the Number of Public Restrooms.</P>

          <p>Ben is infamous for once being elected mayor of his hometown at the age of 18. His inexperience and immaturity was his downfall, and after spending all of the towns money on a complex called "Ice Town" he was sent packing.</p>

          <p>He is a self-professed lover of Calzones, the band Letters to Cleo, and nerdy board games (including the one he created, The Cones of Dunshire). He also hosted a radio program in college called "Zoot Suit Wyatt".</p>
